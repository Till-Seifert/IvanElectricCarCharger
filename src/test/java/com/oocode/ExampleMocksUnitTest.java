/*
WARNING: I don't think this is a good test - here as an example to show how mocks are often used rather than as a
good example of using mocks.

Tests whether the building blocks of the ChargeTimes are plugged together; i.e. whether the report is generated
(by the ReportGenerator) from the best times found (by the BestTimesFinder).

Advantages:
    Independent of the real BestTimesFinder and ReportGenerator

Disadvantages:
    Difficult to see what this is really testing - probably not a useful test
    Arguably this is testing the particular implementation rather than the behaviour we want;
        this sort of test can get in the way of refactoring without adding much benefit in terms of useful testing
