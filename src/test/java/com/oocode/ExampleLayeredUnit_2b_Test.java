/*
A minor variant of ExampleLayeredUnit_2a_Test - the difference being here we've decided to fake the response from the external service at a slightly higher level.

Advantages compared to ExampleLayeredUnit_2a_Test:
    You might prefer this from a design point of view - it is more encapsulated
        e.g. ChargeTimes does not need to know whether the data comes from HTTP or anywhere else

Disadvantages compared to ExampleLayeredUnit_2a_Test:
    Could be an unnecessary level of indirection
    This test tests slightly less of the system; you might want another test to cover the HTTP part
